## Project Overview

For this project I sought to develop predictive models to identify individuals who are at higher risk of developing diabetes based on an array of health-related characteristics. Using this data and predictive models, health-care practicioners can improve patient outcomes by improving early diagnosis/ detection and preemptively implementing personalized treatment strategies for treatment and prevention of diabetes. 

## Business Problem/Stakeholder

A healthcare practice group is looking to improve diabetes diagnosis, improve prognosis of those who are diagnosed and aid assist patients looking to prevent diabetes. Utilizing this data, providers will be able to look for early detection signs of diabetes and then implement corrective strategies early on in the diesease process to either improve the patients outcome and health with the disease or prevent it altogether. Utilizing my model, the goal is to assist practicioners with early detection by identifying which health-related attributes such as blood pressure, glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, and age (other afctors: pregnancies, skinfold thickness, diabetes pedigree function) are more predictive or increase the risk of diabetes.
